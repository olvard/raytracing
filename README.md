# Monte-Carlo Raytracing

From the report:

>The project applies Monte Carlo integration and ray-tracing techniques to calculate complex light interactions within a 3D scene, including reflections, refractions, and diffuse color     >bleeding. The model, developed in C++, is designed to handle multiple light bounces, allowing for accurate simulation of indirect lighting. Results demonstrate the rendererâ€™s effectiveness in >creating realistic images, though at a high computational cost.
